# wifi-bluetooth-on-off-mac
Two executables to turn ON or OFF WiFi or Bluetooth in Mac

## Steps 

1. Install [Blueutil](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/blueutil) using Brew

2. Copy both files content to a new local text file, then remove the **`.txt`** file extension.

   Ex: **`wifi-on`** without an extention.

3. Open Terminal with the same directory and run this command to convert it to an executable file.

   `chmod +x [file_name]` 

   Ex: **`chmod +x wifi-on`**

Keep the files in handy directory..

*Turning the wifi and bluetooth off before your Mac sleeps will reduce the heating and battery drain issue.*
